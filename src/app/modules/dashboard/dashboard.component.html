<h1>Energy Market Dashboard</h1>
<p>
  This application is a self-directed project I built to sharpen my skills in software development, data analysis, and energy market operations. Everything here is simulated and used strictly for educational purposes.

  Nothing on this site reflects real-world operations. You can explore the code on GitHub:

<p><strong>Note:</strong> It may take a few moments for the server to fully spin up when first accessing the application, especially if it's been idle.</p>
